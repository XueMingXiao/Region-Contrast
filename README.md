## Contents
-----------------------------
#### (i) Direction
###### <1> Download the all the documents from: https://github.com/XueMingXiao/Saliency;
###### <2> Put the folder 'Data' and 'Code' under the same folder. Run WaveletSaliency.exe
###### <3> The obtained saliency maps are in the folder: 'Data/DF/Saliency' where 'DF' represents the folder name of Database
#### (ii) Notes
###### <1> In 'Data', there are three DataSets: 'ASD', 'SED2' and randomly setection from 'MSRA'. 
####### (1) ASD is aviliable at:http://ivrlwww.epfl.ch/supplementary_material/RK_CVPR09/; 
####### (2) MSRA is aviliable at: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jiansun/SalientObject/salient_object.htm
####### (3) SED2 is aviliable at: http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~vision/Seg_Evaluation_DB/dl.html
###### <2> You can put your own Dataset under the folder 'Data', make sure your images are in the subfolder 'Imgs'.
###### <3> We did not upload the code implementations of current sate-of-art methods, anyone who want to use codes of these methods for comparison, please see the benchamark of salient object detecion aviliable at Cheng's project page: http://mmcheng.net/salobjbenchmark/
